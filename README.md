# Pharmacy Smart Contract

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a basic pharmacy inventory and sales system deployed on the Monad Testnet. The contract allows the owner to add medicines with a price and stock count, and users to purchase medicines using the native blockchain token. This project demonstrates access control, payable functions, event emission, and contract interaction on a decentralized network.

## Key Features

- Only the contract owner can add medicines  
- Each medicine has a name, price, and stock  
- Users can purchase medicines using blockchain payment  
- Purchase transactions emit events for tracking  
- Contract owner can withdraw funds collected in the contract  
- Deployed on the Monad Testnet
